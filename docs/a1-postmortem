## What goals have been achieved
 
* Bootstrapped app
* Script to set up and deploy locally on docker
* Basic tests 
* Documentation and processes in place
 
## What goals have been missed, and by how much

* Did not implement backend testing by two weeks
 
## How plans will need to be adjusted, based on remaining time available and project scope.

At first, Milestone 3 has been revised from pulling twitter data to pulling FAA bird strike data. Later on, it proved to be not efficient, so we decide to include a Twitter live feed widget to our website.
Based on feature priorities, this feature landed being in Milestones 3 list as it is less important than other features (namely, frontend visualization and backend endpoints). 
Consequently, we will push back completing the full implementation of some features to milestone 3.
 
## What, if any, adjustments or decisions need to be made in light of what we have learned about project scope and capacity since. 

* Decided not to interact with Twitter API directly (as we were planning in the beginning). The reasons for this decision are:
* The data we were planning to pull is less relevant to our questions as we pivoted to exploring bird strike data
* We proposed a other new features such as displaying more meaningful visualizations
* Planned another feature to add a twitter iframe that shares live tweets by AviationSafety that report airplane crashes in real time
